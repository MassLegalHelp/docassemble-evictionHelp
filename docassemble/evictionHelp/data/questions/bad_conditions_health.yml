# it also says later f you have a child under the age of 6, your landlord must remove or properly cover lead paint up to 5 feet from the floor. 
# but lead paint a child can reach is already a serious violation
# should we ask twice? - nope I don't think so - thought maybe - ask twice but use variable so value is already filled in the 2nd time question is asked? Or question is skipped if they have already answered. - possibilities

question: |
  Are there cockroaches, insects or rodents in the building?
  # we could ask this as one question with 3 boxes or just one...If we build an affidavit at any time it's helpful to have specific details but this question isn't that complex if we are not building statements.
