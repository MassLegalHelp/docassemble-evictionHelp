question: |
  Would you like to reschedule your case or reinstate tenancy?
help: |
  Please note, if you choose to reschedule your case, both you and your landlord keep your claims.
  In this case, the original case goes on trial for a judge or jury to decide.
  If you feel that you will not be able to come up with an agreement with your landlord, you may want to choose to reschedule your case.
  If you and your landlord agree to reinstate your tenancy, you can stay in your home and the case will be dismissed after the terms have been met.
