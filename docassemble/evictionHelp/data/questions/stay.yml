question: |
  Would you like to reschedule your case or reinstate tenancy?
  # Do you need to change the date of your case or renew your tenancy agreement?
help: |
  Note, if you change the date of your case:
   - both you and your landlord keep your claims.
   - the original case goes on trial for a judge or jury to decide.
  If you feel  you will not be able to come to an agreement with your landlord, you may need ask the court to change the date of your case.
  # Not sure I understand this one.
  If you and your landlord agree to renew your tenancy, you can stay in your home and the court will dismiss the case once the terms of your agreement have been met.
